# tflite-runtime is loaded via a recipe/wheel on Android; numpy & pillow are
# needed for preprocessing; camera + android permissions handled by pyjnius;
# plyer backs the Home screen's "Upload" button (native gallery/file picker).
# numpy is PINNED: an unversioned "numpy" resolves to a modern release that
# builds via meson, and python-for-android's bootstrap for that build path
# is currently broken (fails with "Exec format error" building numpy's own
# hostpython3 prerequisites). 1.23.2 predates that meson switch and uses
# p4a's much older, battle-tested distutils-based numpy recipe instead.
